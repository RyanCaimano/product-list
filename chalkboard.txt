(1) given: boiler plate for:

  server.js: name of our database is 'products'
            we are pulling the routes in from main.js

  product.js: this is where our model exists

  main.js: this is where our routes are, which will fill our       database with data 

(2) removed this from package.json (line 22) so that I could use faker-js/faker instead...

      "faker": "^6.6.6",
